// THE CONTEXT
// In the provided code, there's an array named shoppingCart representing a user's shopping cart with items containing 'name', 'price', and 'quantity' properties.
// The current code calculates the total price of items in the shopping cart without using functions.

// THE PROBLEM
// - This code works only for this specific shopping cart. But we want to be able to compute the total price for any shopping cart

// YOUR JOB
// Your task is to refactor the code by extracting the logic for calculating the total price into a reusable function.
// Write a function named calculateTotalPrice that takes the shoppingCart array as a parameter and returns the total price.

// TO CHECK
// Check that your code still produce the same result
// Check that your code can work with myny shopping carts

let shoppingCart = [
  { name: "Apples", price: 2.5, quantity: 3 },
  { name: "Bananas", price: 1.5, quantity: 2 },
  { name: "Oranges", price: 3, quantity: 1 },
];
let shoppingCart2 = [
  { name: "Mangoes", price: 4, quantity: 2 },
  { name: "Grapes", price: 3.5, quantity: 1 }
];
let shoppingCart3 = [
  { name: "Milk", price: 2, quantity: 1 },
  { name: "Bread", price: 1.8, quantity: 2 },
  { name: "Eggs", price: 0.25, quantity: 12 }
];

// Calculate total price without using functions
let totalPrice = 0;
function calculateTotalPrice(cart) {
  let total = 0;
for (let item of cart) {
  total += item.price * item.quantity;
}
return total;
}
console.log("Total price:", calculateTotalPrice(shoppingCart));
